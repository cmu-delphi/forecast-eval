The **coverage plot** shows how well a forecaster's confidence intervals performed on a given week, across all locations. The horizontal black line is the selected confidence interval, and the y-values are the percentage of time that the observed values of the target variable value fell into that confidence interval. A perfect forecaster on this measure would follow the black line.  
  
For example, a forecaster wants the observed values to be within the 50% confidence interval in 50% of locations for the given week. If the y-value is above the horizontal line, it means that the observed values fell within the forecaster's 50% CI more than 50% of the time, aka the forecaster's 50% CI was under-confident that week, or too wide. Conversely, if the y-value is below the line, it means that the forecaster's 50% CI was over-confident that week, or too narrow.

All forecasts are evaluated against the latest version of observed data. Some forecasts may be scored against data that are quite different from what was observed when the forecast was made.
