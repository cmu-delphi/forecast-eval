**Coverage** is an estimate of the probability that a forecaster's interval (at a certain nominal level such as 80%) correctly includes the actual value. It is estimated on a particular date by computing the proportion of locations for which a forecaster's interval includes the actual value on that date. A perfectly calibrated forecaster would have each interval's empirical coverage matching its nominal coverage. In the plot, this corresponds to being on the horizontal black line. Overconfidence corresponds to being below the line while underconfidence corresponds to being above the line.
