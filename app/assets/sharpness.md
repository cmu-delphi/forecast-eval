**Spread** is a component of the weighted interval score. It is a weighted average of the widths of the prediction intervals and does not depend on the ground truth. Spread is described in [this article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008618) (note: in this paper spread is defined as "sharpness"). A smaller spread score indicates narrower intervals. Models that have narrower intervals are implying a higher level of certainty in their forecast that may or may not be warranted.
