The **weighted interval score** (WIS) is a proper score that combines a set of interval scores. See [this article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008618) about the WIS method for a more in depth explanation. The WIS factors in both the sharpness of prediction intervals and their calibration (or coverage) of the actual observations.

All forecasts are evaluated against the latest version of observed data. Some forecasts may be scored against data that are quite different from what was observed when the forecast was made.
