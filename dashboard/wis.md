The **weighted interval score** (WIS) is a proper score that combines a set of interval scores. See [this article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008618) about the WIS method for a more in depth explanation. The WIS factors in both the sharpness of prediction intervals and their calibration (or coverage) of the actual observations.
